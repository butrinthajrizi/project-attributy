# Project-attributy
The project-attributy  is worked with the SpaceX API.

## Installation

I used the npm package manager to install the modules

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
npm i
```
So for both frontend and backend folders

## Usage
Go to the backend folder, and then type the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
nodemon index.ts
```
or
```bash
ts-node index.ts
```
Install ts-node or nodemon if you don't already have them by typing:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```
also for nodemon:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
And try this if you are experiencing script problems or other similar issues.
Launch a new instance of PowerShell as an administrator and run:
```bash
 Execution Policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
Then try once more.

For the frontend part,Â merely open the frontend folder and type the following command in the command line:
```bash
npm run dev
```
